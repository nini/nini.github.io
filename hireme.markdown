## I do not take on any projects.

Currently, I’m working part-time for a world-wide active food delivery company. My current activities include, among others:
* Design and apply software architecture patterns
* Develop cloud-native, scalable, and distributed applications
* Troubleshoot and resolve all sorts of issues
* Identify bottlenecks by conducting load tests
* Actively participate and push for tech excellence in the org

I’m versed in the following technologies: Kotlin, Nodejs, Drupal, Magento, Symfony, React, *SQL, AWS, and more. 

You can find my complete list of projects on [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Nikolay_Nikiforov/cv).

This page will be updated.
