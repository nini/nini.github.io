The idea for the program came to my mind during my summer trip to the Baltic sea. 

I was traveling together with my son. Instead of going by car, I was looking to try something new, so I've come up with the idea of going by bus (specifically with Flixbus). 

The trip would take around 7 hours, but as they offer some entertainment and internet on board, I thought we would make it. Indeed, the journey there was delightful. We were sitting in the front row with a huge panorama glass. With some snacks and the internet, the trip was hassle-free.

Our return voyage turned out to be much more problematic. There were no Wi-fi, no entertainment, only boring snacks. Due to my frugalistas lifestyle, I own no mobile internet to reduce fixed costs. There must be another way to kill time.

Have you ever heard of Shortcuts for iPhone? It's an almost full-fledged code editor where one can achieve some fantastic things. 

As a developer I am, I thought of creating a small gambling game - and so the "Guess The Number" game was born. 

iPhone will randomly select a number from 0 to 9. A player needs to try to guess this number. He will be cheered with a voice when losing or winning.
Sounds complicated? Not at all; feel free to try it out yourself!
