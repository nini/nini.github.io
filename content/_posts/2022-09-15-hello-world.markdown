Welcome to my website!

Here is an obligatory post for a developer starting a new blog.

On this resource, I'll write about tech, clever solutions for problems, software design, investing pieces of advice I've learned, and maybe some personal stuff from time to time.

In addition, I plan to run a YouTube channel for those who'd like to get in touch with IT and programming without any prior knowledge and maybe start a developer career.

The store section is aimed at beginners interested in learning to code. I'm thinking of adding some small tangible pieces of software for novice people to help them learn to code efficiently.

Stay tuned!
