While I'm sitting in a tram right now being on the way to the office, I wanted to take this opportunity to announce the launch of my first videos on my YouTube ([@ninilab](https://www.youtube.com/@ninilab)) and TikTok ([@computercommander](https://www.tiktok.com/@computercommander)) channels.

The first video is explaining how easy it is to start programming for a novice person having only an iPhone. It is basically the tutorial prior the final result described on [the separate blog page]({% post_url 2022-09-16-guess-number %}).   

The second video is a Shorts basically about the same topic, but in much more condensed, basic way. Here they come, enjoy.
